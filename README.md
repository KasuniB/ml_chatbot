# ML Chatbot

This project is a QA chatbot using a retrieval and generative approach. The chatbot leverages both pre-existing data (retrieval) and dynamic responses (generative) to provide accurate and context-aware answers.

## Retrieval model
The retieval model used was a TFID vectorizer

## Generative model
The generative model used was the gpt2 model fine-tuned to use our dataset

## Dataset
The dataset used is MedQuad dataset of QA pairs.
